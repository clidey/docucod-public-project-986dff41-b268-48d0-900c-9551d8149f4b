# Set Up Your Plugin Development Environment

## Workflow Overview

This guide walks you through initializing your local development environment for Obsidian plugin development using the Sample Plugin as a starting point. You will clone the sample plugin repository, install necessary dependencies, compile the TypeScript source, and connect it with your Obsidian vault for testing.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed (v16 or later recommended).
- Basic familiarity with command line interface.
- An existing Obsidian vault to load your plugin.

### Expected Outcome

By following this guide, you will have a working, local Obsidian plugin development setup where your plugin code compiles automatically and integrates with your vault for live testing.

### Time Estimate

Approximately 15-30 minutes, depending on familiarity with Git and Node.js.

### Difficulty Level

Beginner to Intermediate

## Step-by-Step Instructions

<Steps>
<Step title="Clone the Sample Plugin Repository">
Open your command line interface and clone the official Obsidian Sample Plugin repository. It is best to clone the plugin inside your Obsidian vault’s plugins folder to ease testing later.

```bash
cd /path/to/your/obsidian/vault/.obsidian/plugins
 git clone https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin sample-plugin
```

**Expected Result:**

The sample plugin source code is downloaded into the "sample-plugin" directory inside your vault's plugin folder.
</Step>

<Step title="Install Node.js Dependencies">
Navigate to the cloned folder and install the project’s Node.js dependencies using npm or yarn.

```bash
cd sample-plugin
npm install
```

This installs all dependencies defined in the project’s package.json necessary to build and run the plugin.

**Expected Result:**

The `node_modules` folder appears with all required packages.
</Step>

<Step title="Compile Plugin Source Code">
Compile the TypeScript source (`main.ts`) into JavaScript (`main.js`) using the build script.

For active development, run the watch command to automatically compile changes:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This triggers esbuild to bundle your code and watch for file updates.

**Expected Result:**

`main.js` is generated and updates automatically when you change `.ts` files.
</Step>

<Step title="Load Plugin into Your Obsidian Vault">
Start or reload Obsidian, navigate to `Settings` → `Community Plugins` → `Installed Plugins`, find "Sample Plugin," and enable it.

**If you do not see the plugin:**

- Verify it is located inside your vault’s `.obsidian/plugins` folder using the correct folder name.
- Reload Obsidian.

**Expected Result:**

The plugin becomes active, and UI elements such as the ribbon icon and commands are available.
</Step>

<Step title="Validate Setup">
Test your plugin’s functionality:

- Click the ribbon icon in Obsidian's left sidebar and verify a notice appears.
- Open Obsidian's command palette and look for commands like "Open sample modal (simple)".
- Check the developer console for expected logs like 'click' or 'setInterval' messages.

**Expected Result:**

Plugin features respond instantly, indicating successful integration.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Use `npm run dev` for fast iteration:** Running the watcher recompiles your code automatically, so you never have to stop and restart the build manually.
- **Place your plugin folder inside your Obsidian vault:** This avoids manual copying and enables loading your development plugin instantly.
- **Follow naming conventions:** Keep your plugin folder and manifest `id` consistent to prevent loading errors.
- **Check Node.js version:** Run `node --version` to verify compatibility.

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Setup Issues">
<Accordion title="Plugin Doesn’t Appear in Obsidian">
- Ensure your cloned plugin is saved inside the exact path: `Vault/.obsidian/plugins/your-plugin-folder/`.
- Confirm your `manifest.json` file exists and is correctly formatted.
- Reload Obsidian to refresh the plugin list.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Build Errors on Compilation">
- Verify you have Node.js v16 or above.
- Run `npm install` again to ensure dependencies are complete.
- Check for errors in your terminal output to identify missing packages or syntax errors.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Changes Not Reflected in Obsidian">
- Confirm `npm run dev` is running and not reporting errors.
- Reload Obsidian to clear cached versions.
- Check the console for errors regarding plugin loading.
</Accordion>

## Example Command: Development Watch

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command uses `esbuild` to compile your TypeScript source with a watcher enabled for immediate rebuilds.

## Example Folder Structure

```
VaultFolder/
  .obsidian/
    plugins/
      sample-plugin/
        main.ts
        main.js
        manifest.json
        styles.css
        package.json
        node_modules/
```

This structure allows Obsidian to detect and load the plugin seamlessly.
