## 2. Step-by-Step Guide to Publishing

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Plugin Guidelines">
Ensure your plugin adheres to the official [Obsidian plugin guidelines](https://docs.obsidian.md/Plugins/Releasing/Plugin+guidelines). These cover compliance, safety, and functionality standards required for acceptance.

- Review guidelines carefully to avoid rejection
- Focus on security and privacy best practices
- Confirm compatibility with stated minimum app version
</Step>

<Step title="Publish Your Initial Version">
Before submission:

- Create and push an initial release on GitHub
  - Tag the release with your version number (e.g., `1.0.0`)
  - Upload the compiled `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and optional `styles.css` files to the release assets
- Validate your `manifest.json` includes fields like `id`, `name`, `version`, `minAppVersion`, `description`, and optionally `fundingUrl`

This step ensures that your plugin is ready for distribution.
</Step>

<Step title="Prepare Your Repository">
- Place a clear and informative `README.md` in the root of your repository
- Make sure the repository is public and accessible
- Verify that `manifest.json` is up to date with your release version and metadata
- Check that the repository follows good structure for easy user and maintainer navigation
</Step>

<Step title="Submit a Pull Request to the Obsidian Releases Repository">
- Go to [https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases)
- Fork the repo to your GitHub account
- Add your plugin's `manifest.json` details to the appropriate plugins list file
- Submit a pull request (PR) describing:
  - Your plugin's purpose
  - Version details
  - Main features

Your PR is the official request to have your plugin included in the community list.
</Step>

<Step title="Respond to Review Feedback">
- Maintain responsiveness to any feedback or requested changes from repository maintainers
- Update your PR and repository as needed to meet standards
- Avoid delays by carefully responding and testing changes
</Step>

<Step title="Celebrate Your Plugin's Inclusion">
Once your PR is merged:

- Your plugin will be listed in Obsidian's community plugins
- Users will be able to discover and install it directly within Obsidian
- Monitor feedback and iterate on improvements
</Step>

</Steps>

## 3. Best Practices to Maximize Audience and Discoverability

- **Clear and Concise Description:** Write a compelling description in your `manifest.json` and `README.md` that highlights your plugin's value.
- **Use Proper Semantic Versioning:** Make meaningful version bumps that reflect changes (major, minor, patch).
- **Keep Documentation Updated:** Provide usage instructions and example scenarios for users inside your repo.
- **Include Funding Links:** Use the `fundingUrl` field to enable supporters to contribute via platforms like Buy Me a Coffee or Patreon.

```json
{
  "fundingUrl": {
    "Buy Me a Coffee": "https://buymeacoffee.com/yourname",
    "GitHub Sponsor": "https://github.com/sponsors/yourname"
  }
}
```
- **Engage with the Community:** Monitor plugin forum posts and GitHub issues to respond promptly.
