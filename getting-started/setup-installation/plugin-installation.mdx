# Installation Methods for the Obsidian Sample Plugin

This guide provides clear, step-by-step instructions to install and set up the Obsidian Sample Plugin using two common methods: development from the template repository and manual installation into your Obsidian vault. Whether you are a plugin developer starting out or a user who wants to add the plugin to your vault, these methods will enable you to get up and running quickly.

---

## 1. Installing via the Sample Plugin Template (Development Approach)

This is the recommended approach if you want to customize, extend, or develop the Sample Plugin.

### Step 1: Create Your Plugin Repository from the Template
- Go to the GitHub repository for the Obsidian Sample Plugin: [https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin)
- Click the "Use this template" button to create your own plugin repository based on this template.

### Step 2: Clone Your Repository Locally
- Clone your newly-created repo to your local machine using Git:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-plugin-repo.git
  ```
- It is recommended to place your plugin folder inside your vault directory under:
  ```plaintext
  YourVault/.obsidian/plugins/your-plugin-id/
  ```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
- Ensure NodeJS v16 or higher is installed on your system. Verify with:
  ```bash
  node --version
  ```
- Navigate into your plugin folder in the command line and install required packages:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

### Step 4: Build and Watch for Changes
- Start plugin compilation in watch mode to auto-compile on code changes:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

### Step 5: Load the Plugin in Obsidian
- Open Obsidian and go to **Settings > Community Plugins > Disabled Plugins**.
- Enable your plugin by toggling it on.
- If this is a new plugin, use **Reload Plugins** after compiling changes.

<Tip>
If you update the Obsidian API version or dependencies, you can run:
```npm update```
inside your plugin folder to keep things up to date.
</Tip>

## 2. Manual Installation into Your Obsidian Vault

Use this method if you want to install the Sample Plugin for immediate use without development.

### Step 1: Download or Build the Plugin Files
- Download the compiled plugin files (`main.js`, `manifest.json`, and optionally `styles.css`) from the latest release or build them yourself using the development approach above.

### Step 2: Copy Files to Vault
- Copy these files into your vault folder under:
  ```plaintext
  YourVault/.obsidian/plugins/sample-plugin/
  ```
- Ensure the folder name matches your plugin's `id` field, which is `sample-plugin` in this pluginâ€™s `manifest.json`.

### Step 3: Enable the Plugin
- Open Obsidian.
- Navigate to **Settings > Community Plugins**.
- Find **Sample Plugin** in the list and toggle it on.

<Check>
If the plugin does not appear in the list, verify that the files are placed under the correct folder and that `manifest.json` includes the proper `id` and `minAppVersion`.
</Check>

---

## Verification

After installation using either method, verify success by:

- Confirming the ribbon icon (a dice) appears on the left sidebar.
- Clicking the ribbon icon shows a notice "This is a notice!".
- Opening the command palette (`Ctrl+P` or `Cmd+P`) and searching for "Open sample modal (simple)" opens a modal with the text "Woah!".

These interactions confirm the plugin is installed and functioning as expected.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Plugin Doesn't Appear in Community Plugins List">
- Verify the plugin files are correctly placed in the vault under `.obsidian/plugins/sample-plugin/`.
- Check `manifest.json` for correct `id` (`sample-plugin`) and `minAppVersion` (should be at least `0.15.0`).
- Reload Obsidian or restart the app after placing files.
- Ensure your Obsidian app version meets the minimum requirement.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Compilation Errors During Development">
- Confirm NodeJS version is 16 or greater using `node --version`.
- Run `npm install` before `npm run dev`.
- Check terminal output for specific errors and look for missing dependencies.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Ribbon Icon or Commands Not Responding">
- Make sure you have enabled the plugin in Community Plugins settings.
- Review the developer console in Obsidian (toggle with `Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Alt+I`) for errors.
- Check that the code compilation succeeded without errors.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Additional Notes

- The plugin requires Obsidian version 0.15.0 or newer. Check your app version under **Settings > About**.
- Development workflows and customization should be done following the guidance in the **Developer Setup** and **Customizing the Sample Plugin** guides.
- For full development instruction, see the [README.md](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin/blob/main/README.md) in the sample plugin repository.
