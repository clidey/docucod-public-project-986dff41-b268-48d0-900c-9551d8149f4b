# Developer Setup Guide

This guide is designed for developers who want to **extend and customize the Obsidian Sample Plugin**. It covers how to set up your local development environment, compile TypeScript sources into JavaScript, and efficiently reload Obsidian for iterative testing.

---

## 1. Setting Up Your Development Environment

### 1.1 Prerequisites
- **NodeJS**: Ensure you have NodeJS v16 or higher installed. Verify by running:

```bash
node --version
```

- **Package Manager**: You can use either `npm` or `yarn`. Both are supported.

- **Obsidian Vault**: Have an Obsidian vault ready where you'll be installing and testing your plugin.

### 1.2 Clone the Plugin Repository

Clone this sample plugin to your local machine to begin development.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin.git
```

For convenience, place the cloned repository inside your vault's plugin folder, typically:

```
<VaultFolder>/.obsidian/plugins/sample-plugin
```

### 1.3 Install Dependencies

Navigate to the plugin directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd obsidian-sample-plugin
npm install
```

Or, if using yarn:

```bash
yarn
```

### 1.4 Key Files and Folders
- `main.ts`: The primary TypeScript entry point where plugin logic lives.
- `manifest.json`: Metadata for your plugin (ID, version, compatibility).
- `styles.css`: Styling for your plugin UI elements.
- `node_modules/`: Installed dependencies.

---

## 2. Compiling TypeScript Sources

Compile your TypeScript source files into JavaScript that Obsidian can load.

### 2.1 Development Mode - Watch Mode

Use this command to compile your plugin continuously while you work. It watches for changes and recompiles automatically:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Expected behavior:
- The `main.ts` file will be compiled into `main.js` inside the plugin folder.
- The process runs in watch mode, tracking changes in your `.ts` files.

### 2.2 Production Build

For preparing a release build, which generates minified code:

```bash
npm run build
```

This ensures your plugin is optimized for release.

### 2.3 Verifying Compilation

Upon running the dev or build commands, confirm:

- The `main.js` file appears in the plugin folder.
- No TypeScript errors appear in the terminal.

<Tip>
If you see errors, address them before continuing. Syntax mistakes or type violations will prevent plugin loading.
</Tip>

## 3. Loading and Testing Your Plugin in Obsidian

Once your plugin is compiled, you need to **reload Obsidian** to see your changes.

### 3.1 Enable the Plugin

If this is your first time installing the plugin in your vault:

1. Open Obsidian.
2. Go to **Settings > Community Plugins**.
3. Click **Enable Community Plugins** if disabled.
4. Locate your plugin by its folder name.
5. Enable it via the toggle switch.

### 3.2 Reloading for New Changes
After any change and recompilation:

- Use the **Reload Plugins** button in Obsidian's settings under Community Plugins.
- Alternatively, restart Obsidian completely.

<Tip>
Frequent reloading is key during development to verify your latest code is running.
</Tip>

## 4. Development Workflow Tips

- **Use Ribbon Icon and Commands to Test:**
  - The sample plugin registers a ribbon icon and commands; interact with these for quick feature testing.

- **Use Console Output:**
  - Use `console.log()` statements inside `main.ts` to monitor plugin behavior in Obsidian's developer console (opened via `Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I`).

- **Editing Settings:**
  - The plugin includes a settings tab accessible under Obsidian's Settings > Plugin options, allowing you to test configuration changes live.

- **Keep Dependencies Updated:**
  - Occasionally run `npm update` or `yarn upgrade` to keep dependencies and Obsidian API typings fresh.

## 5. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Developer Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Plugin Not Loading After Build">
- Verify `main.js` exists and is updated.
- Check the Obsidian console (Developer Tools) for any errors.
- Confirm that `manifest.json` has correct `id` and `version`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="TypeScript Compilation Errors">
- Read the error messages carefully; they indicate location and type issues.
- Fix errors in `main.ts` before re-running `npm run dev`.
- Make sure your TypeScript version is compatible with the codebase.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Changes Not Reflecting After Reload">
- Ensure `npm run dev` or `npm run build` has completed successfully.
- Perform a full Obsidian restart if simple plugin reload fails.
- Clear any caching issues by restarting your system if persistent.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Dependency Issues">
- Run `npm install` or `yarn` again if dependencies are missing.
- Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` then reinstall if you encounter corrupt installs.
</Accordion>
